After Picard is installed, run it and go to the following menus:
    Options / Options:
        User Interface:
            - User interface language: English
        General:
            - Server address: musicbrainz.org
            - Port: 443
            - MussicBrainz Account: Log in
                - MusicBrainz web site should be opened, click "Allow access".
                - Paste the token in Picard.
            - Automatically scan all new files: Enabled.
            - Ignore MBIDs when loading new files: Disabled. When updating your existing file tags, you will probably want to keep the chosen release as is.

        Metadata:
            - Translate artist names to this locale where possible: Enabled. Not sure, but I think this will prevent to have tags with kanjis.
            - Use standardized artist names: Enabled. "Snoop Doggy Dogg" will be "Snoop Dogg".
            - Convert Unicode punctuation characters to ASCII: Disabled. The affected characters are in the metadata we received from the MusicBrainz database already. If it makes sense to remove them, MusicBrainz should do that in the official database. But in fact, the style guidline of MusicBrainz says that "Use of basic ASCII punctuation characters [...] is allowed, but typographically-correct punctuation is preferred." which seems to encourage usage of Unicode punctuation (https://musicbrainz.org/doc/Style/Miscellaneous). In other words: When tagging we should try to mess with the official MusicBrainz database contents as little as possible. Noitce: This setting is currently undocumented, the information here is taken from: http://forums.musicbrainz.org/viewtopic.php?id=4121
            - Use release relationships: Enabled. The more metadata we provide the better.
            - Use track relationships: Enabled. The more metadata we provide the better.
            - Various artists: "Various Artists".
            - Non-album-tracks: "[non-album tracks]".
            
            Preferred Releases:
                - Preferred release types: All sliders at middle position
                - Preferred release countries: <empty>
                - Preferred release formats: <empty>
                
            Genres:
                - Use genres from MusicBrainz. Enabled.
                    - Only use my tags: Disabled.
                    - Fall back on album's artists genres if no genres are found for the realease or release group: Disabled.
                    - Use folksonomy tags as genres: Enabled. While "Genre" is generally a poor concept because it is impossible to accurately determine, it is nice to be able to filter your library by a certain genre when having guests. And because it is very easy to understand that it can never be accurate, everybody will know that and not consider it as absolute truth anyway.
                    - Ignore tags: "seen live, favorites, fixme, owned"
                    - Minimal genre usage: 70%.
                    - Maximum number of genres: 5.
                    - Join multiple tags with: ,
                
            Ratings:
                - Enable track ratings: Disabled. Ratings are pure opinion and quite useless for others.
                
        Tags:
            - Write tags to files: Enabled.
            - Preserve timestamps of tagged files: Disabled. Then you can sort your music library by last modified date and update very old tags.  In addition, when preserving timestamps is disabled, it WILL preserve the access-time of the files, which is useable as "creation"-time on Linux (as long as you mount with "noatime", which we strongly suggest). As the creation-time is what is most interesting to be preserved, disabling "Preserve timestamps" is okay. Also notice: Enabling "Preserve timestamps" will NOT preserve any of the timestamps of the main parent directory of an album if moving of the files is enabled, which we do enable. The permissions of the main parent directory would be the most interesting ones as they are the ones you can sort your library by in your file manager. As preserving those does not work, we have another reason for disabling "Preserve timestamps".
            - Clear existing tags: Disabled. This will make it keep tags from perfect-flac-encode (especially ENCODEDBY).
            - Remove ID3 tags from FLAC files: Enabled. Vorbis Comments are recommended for FLAC files. 
            - Remove APEv2 tags from MP3 files: Enabled.  ID3 is recommended for MP3s. 
            - Preserve these tags from being cleared or overwritten with MusicBrainz data: <empty>. TODO: Add perfect-flac-encode tags.
            - ID3v2 version: 2.3. Version 2.4 is the latest and recommended version, but its support in players is still lacking.
            - ID3v2 text encoding: UTF-16. The default for version 2.4 is UTF-8, the default for version 2.3 is UTF-16.
            - Also include ID3v1 tags in the files: Disabled. ID3v1.1 tags are obsolete and may not work with non-latin scripts.

        Covert art:
            - Embed cover images into tags: Enabled. I want to view the cover when I copy individual tracks to my smartphone.
            - Embed only front images: Enabled.
            - Save cover images as separate files: Enabled, value: "cover"
            - Overwrite the file if it already exists: Enabled. We want to be able to continously keep our file's tags up to date. When updating tags, the cover art should also be updated.
            
        File naming:
            - Move files when saving: Enabled.
            - Destination directory: Select your desired directory..
            - Move additional files: Enabled, "*"
            - Delete empty directories: Enabled. Useful for getting rid of things such as subdirectories for separate discs.
            - Rename files when saving: Enabled.
                - Replace non-ASCII characters: Disabled. The source code of Picard shows that they would be replaced by "_". We work on Linux which supports UTF-8 properly as standard charset so our filesystems can store Unicode properly. Most modern operating systems should support Unicode as well. Further, translating the characters is the job of the code for copying between filesystems which support Unicode and filesystems which don't. Also notice that pure ASCII is a very limited charset, many releases will contain non-ASCII characters.
                - Windows compatibility: Enabled.
                - Name files like this: %albumartist%/%date% - %album%/$if($gt(%totaldiscs%,1),Disc $num(%discnumber%,2) - ,)$num(%tracknumber%,2) - %title%

        Fingerprinting:
            - Audio Fingerprinting->Use AcoustID: Selected. AcoustID is the more open solution.
            - AcoustID Settings->Fingerprint calculator: "/usr/bin/fpcalc".
            - API key: <enter your API key>
            
        CD Lookup:
            - Default CD-ROM drive to use for lookups: <select the drive you use for ripping>
            
        Plugins:
            * Notice that you need to maximize the settings window to see the full description of a selected plugin.
            - Add Cluster As Release: Enabled. Very useful for adding new releases to the database.
            - Classic Disc Numbers: Disabled. We shouldn't mess with official style guidelines (see http://musicbrainz.org/doc/Style/Old_style_practices). Also notice: Storing disc numbers in separate tags is necessary for players being able to group albums.
            - Copy Cluster to Clipboard: Enabled. Useful for updating existing releases in the database, for example such without track lengths.
            - Disc Numbers: Disabled. This plugin is legacy. Disc numbers in the title are deprecated on MusicBrainz nowadays, they are stored in their own tag. See: http://musicbrainz.org/doc/Style/Old_style_practices
            - Feat. Artists Removed: Disabled. We shouldn't mess with official style guidelines.
            - Feat. Artists in Title: Disabled.  We shouldn't mess with official style guidelines. Also, it doesn't make any sense to store Artists in the Title-tag given that there is an Artist-tag.
            - Generate Cuesheet: Disabled. The Cuesheet should be read from the CD by the ripping-software for accuracy. Further, we use perfect-flac-encode which copies the Cuesheet to the release directory.
            - Last.fm: Disabled. MusicBrainz does provide Folksonomy-tags for Genre. We should prefer those to the closed, proprietary Last.fm system.
            - Last.fm plus: Disabled. MusicBrainz does provide Folksonomy-tags for Genre. We should prefer those to the closed, proprietary Last.fm system. This also applies to the other content which this plugin provides.
            - No release: Disabled. From looking at the source code, as of 2013-03-25 this doesn't actually have any code for detecting an "unknown origin". Instead, the purpose of this plugin seems to be to allow the user to decide that something is from an unknown origin and remove the tags then. We suggest using AcoustID as primary source of information when using Picard ("Scan" button), and the AcoustID identification should work even if you don't know where your release came from. Also, if an release is of a very strange origin, we shouldn't use it anyway, so we don't need this.
            - Release Type: Disabled. We shouldn't mess with official style guidelines (see http://musicbrainz.org/doc/Style/Titles#Format_designations_in_titles).
            - ReplayGain: Disabled. We recommend using ReplayGain very very much, but as of version 0.1 the implementation of the plugin is not suitable for our purposes: It won't tell mp3gain to use ID3v2 tags, which will make it use its default of APEv2. Also, please note that as of mp3gain version 1.5.2, mp3gain has a bug which will make it screw up the DATE tag when being used for writing ID3v2, so mp3gain would be pretty useless anyway, even if the plugin was using it properly. And as this settings file is intended for being used with perfect-flac-encode, we don't need ReplayGain for FLAC because PFE will tell the FLAC encoder to add it already. Please use the music player of your choice to add ReplayGain. 
            - Title Case: Disabled. We shouldn't mess with official style guidelines.
